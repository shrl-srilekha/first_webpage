                    <p>Fashion is the armor to survive the reality of everyday life."</p>
                    <p>When you think of fashion photography, it's a dream. It's like we all want to be those women.
                        We want to wear those dresses.The most important part of fashion photography, for me, is not the models; 
                        it's not the clothes. It's that you are responsible for defining what 
                        a woman today is.That I think is my job.</p>
